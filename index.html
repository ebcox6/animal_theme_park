    <h1>Animal-Themed Theme Park Project</h1>
    <p>Welcome, 6th Grade Theme Park Designers! Get ready for an exciting adventure! Imagine you’ve just been hired as a superstar design team for the coolest amusement park company on the planet. Your mission is to create the wildest, most amazing animal-themed amusement park ever! But there's a twist—you need to make it all about celebrating the incredible animals and habitats of one of Earth’s continents, while also inspiring visitors to help protect these creatures and their homes. Your park will be full of fun, thrills, and learning—where every ride, habitat, and snack stand has a story to tell!</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>You and your group will be assigned a continent to represent in your theme park. Your goal is to design a park that highlights the incredible animals, their natural habitats, and the importance of conserving these habitats. Each group will create an exhibit that includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Animal Attraction/Habitat:</span> Create a model of an animal habitat or attraction that features animals from your continent. This could be a rainforest, savanna, tundra, or any natural environment where the animals live.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Themed Amusement Ride:</span> Design an exciting ride inspired by the animals or environments of your continent. Imagine the thrill of zooming through a jungle or flying over mountains!</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Concession Stand:</span> Invent a themed concession stand that offers snacks inspired by the continent. Think of interesting names or foods that could connect to the animals or culture of the area.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Souvenir Shop:</span> Create a souvenir shop that features items to help guests remember their adventure, while also promoting conservation. You could include educational posters, plush animals, or even recycled-material gifts.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Your Final Product</h2>
        <p>Your group will create a <span class="highlight">trifold board</span> that will be displayed during our "Theme Park Science Fair." The board should include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Information about your assigned continent.</li>
            <li>Details about the animals that live there and the conservation efforts needed to protect them.</li>
            <li>Pictures, drawings, and fun facts to make your board interesting and engaging.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally, you will build a <span class="highlight">diorama or shadow box</span> (like using a shoebox) that shows one section of your theme park. This could be the animal habitat, the ride, the concession stand, or the souvenir shop. Your group’s diorama will be part of a larger park map that includes all the continents and their attractions!</p>
